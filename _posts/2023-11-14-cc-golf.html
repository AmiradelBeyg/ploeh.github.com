        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">Cyclomatic complexity</a> (CC) is a rare code metric since it <a href="/2019/12/09/put-cyclomatic-complexity-to-good-use">can be actually useful</a>. In general, it's a good idea to minimise it as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, CC measures looping and branching in code, and this is often where bugs lurk. While it's only a rough measure, I nonetheless find the metric useful as a general guideline. Lower is better.

    <p>
        I'd like to propose the term "CC golf" for the activity of minimising cyclomatic complexity in an area of code. The name derives from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">code golf</a>, in which you have to implement some behaviour (typically an algorithm) in fewest possible characters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such games can be useful because they enable you to explore different ways to express yourself in code. It's always a good <a href="/2020/01/13/on-doing-katas">kata constraint</a>. The <a href="/2011/05/16/TennisKatawithimmutabletypesandacyclomaticcomplexityof1">first time I tried that was in 2011</a>, and when looking back on that code today, I'm not that impressed. Still, it taught me a valuable lesson about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor pattern</a> that I never forgot, and that later enabled me to <a href="/2018/06/25/visitor-as-a-sum-type">connect some important dots</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But don't limit CC golf to katas and the like. Try it in your production code too. Most production code I've seen could benefit from some CC golf, and if you <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/12/19/use-git-tactically/">use Git tactically</a> you can always stash the changes if they're no good.

        Idiomatic tension <a href="#f7e54cb8b9954fbd9ed8022ad09f5d7f">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Alternative expressions with lower cyclomatic complexity may not always be idiomatic. Let's look at a few examples. In my <a href="/2023/11/13/fakes-are-test-doubles-with-contracts">previous article</a>, I listed some test code where some helper methods had a CC of <em>2</em>. Here's one of them:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;IEnumerable&lt;DateOnly&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">EnumerateDates</span>(DateOnly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">arrival</span>,&nbsp;DateOnly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">departure</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">d</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;arrival;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">while</span>&nbsp;(d&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;departure)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">yield</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;d;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;=&nbsp;d.AddDays(1);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Can you express this functionality with a CC of <em>1?</em> In <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> it's essentially built in as <code>(. pred) . enumFromTo</code>, and in <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a> it's also idiomatic, although more verbose:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;enumerateDates&nbsp;(arrival&nbsp;:&nbsp;DateOnly)&nbsp;departure&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seq.initInfinite&nbsp;id&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.map&nbsp;arrival.AddDays&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.takeWhile&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">fun</span>&nbsp;d&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;d&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;departure)</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Can we do the same in C#?
    </p>
    <p>
        If there's a general API in .NET that corresponds to the F#-specific <code>Seq.initInfinite</code> I haven't found it, but we can do something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;IEnumerable&lt;DateOnly&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">EnumerateDates</span>(DateOnly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">arrival</span>,&nbsp;DateOnly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">departure</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">const</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;infinity&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>.MaxValue;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;As&nbsp;close&nbsp;as&nbsp;int&nbsp;gets,&nbsp;at&nbsp;least</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;Enumerable.Range(0,&nbsp;infinity).Select(arrival.AddDays).TakeWhile(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">d</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;d&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;departure);
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        In C# infinite sequences are generally unusual, but <em>if</em> you were to create one, a combination of <code>while true</code> and <code>yield return</code> would be the most idiomatic. The problem with that, though, is that such a construct has a cyclomatic complexity of <em>2</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The above suggestion gets around that problem by pretending that <code>int.MaxValue</code> is infinity. Practically, at least, a 32-bit signed integer can't get larger than that anyway. I haven't tried to let F#'s <a href="https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-collections-seqmodule.html#initInfinite">Seq.initInfinite</a> run out, but by its type it seems <code>int</code>-bound as well, so in practice it, too, probably isn't infinite. (Or, if it is, the index that it supplies will have to overflow and wrap around to a negative value.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Is this alternative C# code better than the first? You be the judge of that. It has a lower cyclomatic complexity, but is less idiomatic. This isn't uncommon. In languages with a procedural background, there's often tension between lower cyclomatic complexity and how 'things are usually done'.
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p>
        Is there a way to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of the <code>GetView</code> helper method?
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Room&gt;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">GetView</span>(DateOnly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">date</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(views.TryGetValue(date,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">out</span>&nbsp;var&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">view</span>))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;view;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">else</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;rooms;
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an example of the built-in API being in the way. In F#, you naturally write the same behaviour with a CC of <em>1:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;getView&nbsp;(date&nbsp;:&nbsp;DateOnly)&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;views&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Map.tryFind&nbsp;date&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Option.defaultValue&nbsp;rooms&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Set.ofSeq</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        That <code>TryGet</code> idiom is in the way for further CC reduction, it seems. It <em>is</em> possible to reach a CC of <em>1</em>, though, but it's neither pretty nor idiomatic:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Room&gt;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">GetView</span>(DateOnly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">date</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;views.TryGetValue(date,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">out</span>&nbsp;var&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">view</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;view,&nbsp;rooms&nbsp;}.Where(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">x</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;x&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;{&nbsp;}).First()!;
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps there's a better way, but if so, it escapes me. Here, I use my knowledge that <code>view</code> is going to remain <code>null</code> if <code>TryGetValue</code> doesn't find the dictionary entry. Thus, I can put it in front of an array where I put the fallback value <code>rooms</code> as the second element. Then I filter the array by only keeping the elements that are <em>not</em> <code>null</code> (that's what the <code>x is { }</code> pun means; I usually read it as <em>x is something</em>). Finally, I return the first of these elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know that <code>rooms</code> is never <code>null</code>, but apparently the compiler can't tell. Thus, I have to suppress its anxiety with the <code>!</code> operator, telling it that this <em>will</em> result in a non-null value.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would never use such a code construct in a professional C# code base.

    </h3>
    <p>
        The third helper method suggests another kind of problem that you may run into:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">RoomBooked</span>(Booking&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">booking</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">foreach</span>&nbsp;(var&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">d</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">in</span>&nbsp;EnumerateDates(booking.Arrival,&nbsp;booking.Departure))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">view</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;GetView(d);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">newView</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;QueryService.Reserve(booking,&nbsp;view);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;views[d]&nbsp;=&nbsp;newView;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here the higher-than-one CC stems from the need to loop through dates in order to produce a side effect for each. Even in F# I do that:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">member</span>&nbsp;this.RoomBooked&nbsp;booking&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">for</span>&nbsp;d&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;enumerateDates&nbsp;booking.Arrival&nbsp;booking.Departure&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">do</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;newView&nbsp;=&nbsp;getView&nbsp;d&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;QueryService.reserve&nbsp;booking&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.toList
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;views&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;Map.add&nbsp;d&nbsp;newView&nbsp;views</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        This also has a cyclomatic complexity of <em>2</em>. You could do something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">member</span>&nbsp;this.RoomBooked&nbsp;booking&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enumerateDates&nbsp;booking.Arrival&nbsp;booking.Departure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.iter&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">fun</span>&nbsp;d&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;newView&nbsp;=&nbsp;getView&nbsp;d&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;QueryService.reserve&nbsp;booking&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.toList&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;views&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;Map.add&nbsp;d&nbsp;newView&nbsp;views)</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        but while that nominally has a CC of <em>1</em>, it has the same level of indentation as the previous attempt. This seems to indicate, at least, that it doesn't <em>really</em> address any complexity issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could also try something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">member</span>&nbsp;this.RoomBooked&nbsp;booking&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enumerateDates&nbsp;booking.Arrival&nbsp;booking.Departure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.map&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">fun</span>&nbsp;d&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;d,&nbsp;getView&nbsp;d&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;QueryService.reserve&nbsp;booking&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.toList)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&gt;&nbsp;Seq.iter&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">fun</span>&nbsp;(d,&nbsp;newView)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;views&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;Map.add&nbsp;d&nbsp;newView&nbsp;views)</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        which, again, may be nominally better, but forced me to wrap the <code>map</code> output in a tuple so that both <code>d</code> and <code>newView</code> is available to <code>Seq.iter</code>. I tend to regard that as a code smell.
    </p>
    <p>
        This latter version is, however, fairly easily translated to C#:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">RoomBooked</span>(Booking&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">booking</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EnumerateDates(booking.Arrival,&nbsp;booking.Departure)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Select(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">d</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;(d,&nbsp;view:&nbsp;QueryService.Reserve(booking,&nbsp;GetView(d))))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ToList()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ForEach(<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">x</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;views[x.d]&nbsp;=&nbsp;x.view);
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The standard .NET API doesn't have something equivalent to <code>Seq.iter</code> (although you could trivially write such an action), but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1509450/126014">you can convert any sequence to a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> and use its <code>ForEach</code> method</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, though, I tend to <a href="https://ericlippert.com/2009/05/18/foreach-vs-foreach/">agree with Eric Lippert</a>. There's already an idiomatic way to iterate over each item in a collection, and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">being explicit</a> is generally helpful to the reader.

        Church encoding <a href="#5f060ce8557043dfb0f374ef254cc922">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        There's a general solution to most of CC golf: Whenever you need to make a decision and branch between two or more pathways, you can model that with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">sum type</a>. In C# you can mechanically model that with <a href="/2018/05/22/church-encoding">Church encoding</a> or <a href="/2018/06/25/visitor-as-a-sum-type">the Visitor pattern</a>. If you haven't tried that, I recommend it for the exercise, but once you've done it enough times, you realise that it requires little creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, in 2021 I <a href="/2021/08/03/the-tennis-kata-revisited">revisited the Tennis kata</a> with the explicit purpose of translating <a href="/2016/02/10/types-properties-software">my usual F# approach to the exercise</a> to C# using Church encoding and the Visitor pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've got a sense for how Church encoding enables you to simulate pattern matching in C#, there are few surprises. You may also rightfully question what is gained from such an exercise:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;IScore&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">VisitPoints</span>(IPoint&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">playerOnePoint</span>,&nbsp;IPoint&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">playerTwoPoint</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;playerWhoWinsBall.Match(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;playerOne:&nbsp;playerOnePoint.Match&lt;IScore&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love:&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Points(<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Fifteen(),&nbsp;playerTwoPoint),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifteen:&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Points(<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Thirty(),&nbsp;playerTwoPoint),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirty:&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Forty(playerWhoWinsBall,&nbsp;playerTwoPoint)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;playerTwo:&nbsp;playerTwoPoint.Match&lt;IScore&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love:&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Points(playerOnePoint,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Fifteen()),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifteen:&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Points(playerOnePoint,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Thirty()),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirty:&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;Forty(playerWhoWinsBall,&nbsp;playerOnePoint)));
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Believe it or not, but that method has a CC of <em>1</em> despite the double indentation strongly suggesting that there's some branching going on. To a degree, this also highlights the limitations of the cyclomatic complexity metric. Conversely, <a href="/2021/03/29/table-driven-tennis-scoring">stupidly simple code may have a high CC rating</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the examples in this article border on the pathological, and I don't recommend that you write code <em>like</em> that. I recommend that you do the exercise. In less pathological scenarios, there are real benefits to be reaped.

    <p>
        In 2015 I published an article titled <a href="/2015/08/03/idiomatic-or-idiosyncratic">Idiomatic or idiosyncratic?</a> In it, I tried to explore the idea that the notion of idiomatic code can sometimes hold you back. I revisited that idea in 2021 in an article called <a href="/2021/05/17/against-consistency">Against consistency</a>. The point in both cases is that just because something looks unfamiliar, it doesn't mean that it's bad.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coding idioms somehow arose. If you believe that there's a portion of natural selection involved in the development of coding idioms, you may assume by default that idioms represent good ways of doing things.
    </p>
    <p>
        To a degree I believe this to be true. Many idioms represent the best way of doing things at the time they settled into the shape that we now know them. Languages and contexts change, however. Just look at <a href="/2019/07/15/tester-doer-isomorphisms">the many approaches to data lookups</a> there have been over the years. For many years now, C# has settled into the so-called <em>TryParse</em> idiom to solve that problem. In my opinion this represents a local maximum.
    </p>
    <p>
        Languages that provide <a href="/2018/06/04/church-encoded-maybe">Maybe</a> (AKA <code>option</code>) and <a href="/2018/06/11/church-encoded-either">Either</a> (AKA <code>Result</code>) types offer a superior alternative. These types naturally compose into <em>CC 1</em> pipelines, whereas <em>TryParse</em> requires you to stop what you're doing in order to check a return value. How very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like.
    </p>
    <p>
        All that said, I still think you should write idiomatic code by default, but don't be a slave by what's considered idiomatic, just as you shouldn't be a slave to consistency. If there's a better way of doing things, choose the better way.

    <p>
        While cyclomatic complexity is a rough measure, it's one of the few useful programming metrics I know of. It should be as low as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most professional code I encounter implements decisions almost exclusively with language primitives: <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>, <code>while</code>, etc. Once, an organisation hired me to give a one-day <em>anti-if</em> workshop. There are other ways to make decisions in code. Most of those alternatives reduce cyclomatic complexity.
