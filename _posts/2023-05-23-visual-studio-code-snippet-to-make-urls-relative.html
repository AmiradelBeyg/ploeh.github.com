        Ever since I <a href="/2013/03/03/moving-the-blog-to-jekyll">migrated the blog off dasBlog</a> I've been <a href="https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/">writing the articles in raw HTML</a>. The reason is mostly a historical artefact: Originally, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Writer">Windows Live Writer</a>, but <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> had no support for that, and since I'd been doing web development for more than a decade already, raw HTML seemed like a reliable and durable alternative. I increasingly find that relying on skill and knowledge is a far more durable strategy than relying on technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a decade I used <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> to write articles, but over the years, I found it degrading in quality. I only used Sublime Text to author blog posts, so when I recently repaved my machine, I decided to see if I could do without it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since I was already using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> for much of my programming, I decided to give it a go for articles as well. It always takes time when you decide to move off a tool you've been used for a decade, but after some initial frustrations, I quickly found a new modus operandi.
    </p>
    <p>
        One benefit of rocking the boat is that it prompts you to reassess the way you do things. Naturally, this happened here as well.

        My quest for relative URLs <a href="#28218d2cd10945e0886bd528cf2d792f">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I'd been using a few Sublime Text snippets to automate a few things, like the markup for the section heading you see above this paragraph. Figuring out how to replicate that snippet in Visual Studio Code wasn't too hard, but as I was already perusing <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets">the snippet documentation</a>, I started investigating other options.
    </p>
    <p>
        One little annoyance I'd lived with for years was adding links to other articles on the blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I write an article, I run the site on my local machine. When linking to other articles, I sometimes use the existing page address off the public site, and sometimes I just copy the page address from <code>localhost</code>. In both cases, I want the URL to be relative so that I can navigate the site even if I'm offline. I've written enough articles on planes or while travelling without internet that this is an important use case for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if I want to link to the article <a href="/2023/01/02/adding-nuget-packages-when-offline">Adding NuGet packages when offline</a>, I want the URL to be <code>/2023/01/02/adding-nuget-packages-when-offline</code>, but that's not the address I get when I copy from the browser's address bar. Here, I get the full URL, with either <code>http://localhost:4000/</code> or <code>https://blog.ploeh.dk/</code> as the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
        For years, I've been manually stripping the origin away, as well as the trailing <code>/</code>. Looking through the Visual Studio Code snippet documentation, however, I eyed an opportunity to automate that workflow.
    </p>
    <h3 id="f13d4bb7acf84183b9ac18088206f0ca">
        Snippet <a href="#f13d4bb7acf84183b9ac18088206f0ca">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I wanted a piece of editor automation that could modify a URL after I'd pasted it into the article. After a few iterations, I've settled on a <em>surround-with</em> snippet that works pretty well. It looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;Make&nbsp;URL&nbsp;relative&quot;</span>:&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;prefix&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urlrel&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;body&quot;</span>:&nbsp;[&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;${TM_SELECTED_TEXT/^(?:http(?:s?):\\/\\/(?:[^\\/]+))(.+)\\//$1/}&quot;</span>&nbsp;],
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;description&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Make&nbsp;URL&nbsp;relative.&quot;</span>
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't you just love regular expressions? Write once, scrutinise forever.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't want to go over all the details, because I've already forgotten most of them, but essentially this expression strips away the URL origin starting with either <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> until it finds the first slash <code>/</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The thing that makes it useful, though, is the <code>TM_SELECTED_TEXT</code> variable that tells Visual Studio Code that this snippet works on <em>selected</em> text.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I paste a URL into an <code>a</code> tag, at first nothing happens because no text is selected. I can then use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> to expand the selection, at which point the Visual Studio Code lightbulb (<em>Code Action</em>) appears:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/content/binary/make-url-relative-screen-shot.png" alt="Screen shot of the make-URL-relative code snippet in action.">
    </p>
    <p>
        Running the snippet removes the URL's origin, as well as the trailing slash, and I can move on to write the link text.
    </p>

        Conclusion <a href="#4e72443f63fe42e382e854fdc9a8d07a">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        After I started using Visual Studio Code to write blog posts, I've created a few custom snippets to support my authoring workflow. Most of them are fairly mundane, but the <em>make-URLs-relative</em> snippet took me a few iterations to get right.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not expecting many of my readers to have this particular need, but I hope that this outline showcases the capabilities of Visual Studio Code snippets, and perhaps inspires you to look into creating custom snippets for your own purposes.

                Seems like a useful function to have, so I naturally wondered if I could <del>make it worse</del>
                <ins>implement a similar function in Emacs</ins>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emacs lisp has support for regular expressions, only typically with a bunch of extra slashes
                included, so I needed to figure out how to work with the currently selected text to get this to work.
                The currently selected text is referred to as the "region" and by specifying <code>"r"</code> as a parameter
                for the <code>interactive</code> call we can pass the start and end positions for the region directly to the function.
            </p>
            <p>
                I came up with this rather basic function:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
(defun make-url-relative (start end)
  "Converts the selected uri from an absolute url and converts it to a relative one.
This is very simple and relies on the url starting with http/https, and removes each character to the
first slash in the path"
  (interactive "r")
  (replace-regexp-in-region "http[s?]:\/\/.+\/" "" start end))
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                With this function included in config somewhere: it can be called by selecting a url, and using <kbd>M-x</kbd>
                <code>make-url-relative</code> (or assigned to a key binding as required)
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not sure if there's an already existing package for this functionality, but I hadn't really thought to look for it before
                so thanks for the idea ðŸ˜Š
