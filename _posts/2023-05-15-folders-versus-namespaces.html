    <p>
        I'm currently writing C# code with some first-year computer-science students. Since most things are new to them, they sometimes do things in a way that are 'not the way we usually do things'. As an example, teachers have instructed them to use namespaces, but apparently no-one have told them that the file folder structure has to mirror the namespace structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        The compiler doesn't care, but as long as I've been programming in C#, it's been idiomatic to do it that way. There's even <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0130">a static code analysis rule</a> about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first couple of times they'd introduce a namespace without a corresponding directory, I'd point out that they are supposed to keep those things in sync. One day, however, it struck me: What happens if you flout that convention?

        Code scaffolding tools and wizards will often nudge you to organise your code according to technical concerns: Controllers, models, views, etc. I'm sure you've encountered more than one code base organised like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/content/binary/code-organised-by-tech-responsibility.png" alt="Code organised into folders like Controllers, Models, DataAccess, etc.">
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll put all your Controller classes in the <em>Controllers</em> directory, and make sure that the namespace matches. Thus, in such a code base, the full name of the <code>ReservationsController</code> might be <code>Ploeh.Samples.Restaurants.RestApi.Controllers.ReservationsController</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A common criticism is that this is the <em>wrong</em> way to organise the code.

    <p>
        The complaint that this is the wrong way to organise code implies that a correct way exists. I write about this in <a href="/2021/06/14/new-book-code-that-fits-in-your-head">Code That Fits in Your Head</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Should you create a subdirectory for Controllers, another for Models, one for Filters, and so on? Or should you create a subdirectory for each feature?
        </p>
        <p>
            Few people like my answer: <em>Just put all files in one directory.</em> Be wary of creating subdirectories just for the sake of 'organising' the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            File systems are <em>hierarchies</em>; they are trees: a specialised kind of acyclic graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. Put another way, each vertex can have at most one parent. Even more bluntly: If you put a file in a hypothetical <code>Controllers</code> directory, you can't <em>also</em> put it in a <code>Calendar</code> directory.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        But what if you could?

        Namespaces disconnected from directory hierarchy <a href="#bcdc2397846c45a9bcb3cea0e71cfa7a">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The code that accompanies <em>Code That Fits in Your Head</em> is organised as advertised: 65 files in a single directory. (Tests go in separate directories, though, as they belong to separate libraries.)
    </p>
    <p>
        If you decide to ignore the convention that namespace structure should mirror folder structure, however, you now have a second axis of variability.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an experiment, I decided to try that idea with the book's code base. The above screen shot shows the stereotypical organisation according to technical responsibility, after I moved things around. To be clear: This isn't how the book's example code is organised, but an experiment I only now carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you open the <code>ReservationsController.cs</code> file, however, I've now declared that it belongs to a namespace called <code>Ploeh.Samples.Restaurants.RestApi.Reservations</code>. Using Visual Studio's <em>Class View</em>, things look different from the <em>Solution Explorer:</em>

    </p>
    <p>
        Here I've organised the namespaces according to feature, rather than technical role. The screen shot shows the <em>Reservations</em> feature opened, while other features remain closed.
    </p>

    <p>
        This article isn't a recommendation. It's nothing but an initial exploration of an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do I like it? So far, I think I still prefer flat directory structures. Even though this idea gives two axes of variability, you still have to make judgment calls. It's easy enough with Controllers, but where do you put cross-cutting concerns? Where do you put domain logic that seems to encompass everything else?
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, the code base that accompanies <em>Code That Fits in Your Head</em> is a multi-tenant system. Each restaurant is a separate tenant, but I've modelled restaurants as part of the domain model, and I've put that 'feature' in its own namespace. Perhaps that's a mistake; at least, I now have the code wart that I have to import the <code>Ploeh.Samples.Restaurants.RestApi.Restaurants</code> namespace to implement the <code>ReservationsController</code>, because its constructor looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ReservationsController</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IClock&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">clock</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRestaurantDatabase&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">restaurantDatabase</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IReservationsRepository&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">repository</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clock&nbsp;=&nbsp;clock;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RestaurantDatabase&nbsp;=&nbsp;restaurantDatabase;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repository&nbsp;=&nbsp;repository;
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>IRestaurantDatabase</code> interface is defined in the <code>Restaurants</code> namespace, but the Controller needs it in order to look up the restaurant (i.e. tenant) in question.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could argue that this isn't a problem with namespaces, but rather a code smell indicating that I should have organised the code in a different way.
    </p>
    <p>
        That may be so, but then implies a deeper problem: Assigning files to hierarchies may not, after all, help much. It looks as though things are organised, but if the assignment of things to buckets is done without a predictable system, then what benefit does it provide? Does it make things easier to find, or is the sense of order mostly illusory?
    </p>
    <p>
        I tend to still believe that this is the case. This isn't a nihilistic or defeatist position, but rather a realisation that order must arise from other origins.

    <p>
        I was recently repeatedly encountering student code with a disregard for the convention that namespace structure should follow directory structure (or the other way around). Taking a cue from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> I decided to investigate what happens if you forget about the rules and instead pursue what that new freedom might bring.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this article, I briefly show an example where I reorganised a code base so that the file structure is according to implementation detail, but the namespace hierarchy is according to feature. Clearly, I could also have done it the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
        What if, instead of two, you have three organising principles? I don't know. I can't think of a third kind of hierarchy in a language like C#.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a few hours reorganising the code, I'm not scared away from this idea. It might be worth to revisit in a larger code base. On the other hand, I'm still not convinced that forcing a hierarchy over a sophisticated software design is particularly beneficial.
